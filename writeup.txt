This model uses tranfer learning from the Residual Network 50 layers. The dataset used has 2  labels alien and predator and the training set has 347 images per label and validation set has 100 images per label. Every part of the code comes along with a comment to make the code easily readable. I was able to achieve an accuracy of >90% using transfer learning.
